# Import File Optimization and Documentation

## Test on Import Speed, Memory Usage, and Error Handling

### Reporting

1. **Speed Evaluation**:
   - Measured total import time from logs, chunk processing times.
     ```sh
     Handling 10 records
     [2024-07-12 17:25:46] local.INFO: Import completed in:5.0224339962006seconds. 

     Handling 500,000 records
     [2024-07-12 21:44:35] local.INFO: Import completed in:1879.9794299603seconds.  
     ```

2. **Memory Analysis**:
   - Monitored memory usage using Laravel logging before and after imports.
     ```sh
     Handling 10 records
     [2024-07-12 17:25:46] local.INFO: Memory usage: 18937616 bytes.

     Handling 500,000 records
     [2024-07-12 21:44:35] local.INFO: Memory usage: 141710552 bytes.
     ```

3. **Error Handling Validation**:
   - Added try and catch block in all important events and the error are stored in logging

### Documentation

## Setup Instructions

1. **Database Configuration**:
   - Ensure `sales` and `job` tables are correctly configured.

2. **Model and Job Setup**:
   - Confirm `Sales` model and job classes (`ProcessSalesImport`, `ProcessSalesInBatch`) are set up.
   - Import `"maatwebsite/excel": "3.1.55"` in `composer.json` file for process Excel file.

3. **Queue Configuration**:
   - Adjust `.env` for queue driver (`QUEUE_CONNECTION=database`) and memory limits (`memory_limit=2048M`).

## Execution

1. **File Upload**:
   - Utilize an HTML form or Postman to upload Excel files to the import endpoint.

2. **Queue Worker Activation**:
   - Run the queue worker to process jobs:
     ```sh
     php artisan queue:work --memory=2048M --timeout=3600 --sleep=3 --tries=3
     ```

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Utilized logging for job progress and identified the errors, execution time, memory usage.

## Deployment Considerations

1. **Queue Worker Setup**:
   - Deploy and manage the queue worker with Supervisor for continuous operation.

2. **Resource Management**:
   - Ensure adequate server resources for handling large imports and adjust configurations as needed.

3. **Error Handling and Alerts**:
   - Implement robust error handling and setup alerts for critical errors.

4. **Scaling Strategies**:
   - Consider distributed queue systems for scalability, optimize database operations for efficiency.

By following these guidelines, optimize Laravel import process for performance, reliability, and scalability.
